## 👋 About Me

🚀 **Senior DevOps Engineer** with **10+ years of IT experience** and **7+ years of hands-on DevOps expertise** in building, automating, and operating **scalable, secure, and production-grade cloud infrastructure**.

I specialize in **Microsoft Azure**, **Terraform**, and **Kubernetes**, delivering **end-to-end CI/CD pipelines**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, and **cloud automation** solutions. I have strong experience in **DevSecOps**, containerization using **Docker**, and implementing **observability and monitoring** for high-availability systems.

I work closely with development, security, and operations teams in **Agile environments** to deliver **reliable, resilient, and cost-optimized platforms**.

💡 *I design cloud infrastructure that developers trust and systems can scale on.*
